# DanielleSucher/feedback

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository (inspired by
[holman/feedback](https://github.com/holman/feedback) by way of [janl/feedback](https://github.com/janl/feedback)).

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/DanielleSucher/feedback/issues/new) on this
project.

I’ll try to answer your question as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer, I’ll close the
issue just so I know what I’ve covered, but don’t worry - if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I’ll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask questions on any old issues too, even if you didn't create them.

I’m happy to answer any questions you might have for me personally. I value feedback and 
conversations about the topics that interest me. (And if you come up with questions about 
interesting stuff I don't know yet, odds are I might dive down a rabbit hole for our mutual 
education and delight. So it goes.)

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/DanielleSucher/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I’ve answered in the past. I'm going to try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, or just want to be buddies and trade gleefully nerdy quips, links, and emoji all day, 
feel free to ping me on Twitter. 140 characters makes everyone more efficient. I’m 
[@DanielleSucher](https://twitter.com/DanielleSucher) on Twitter.
